    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 tbsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp minced fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tbsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground tumeric</li>
        <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>15 oz can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
        <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken breasts with 2 teaspoons salt.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat; partially cook the chicken in the hot oil in batches until completely browned on all sides. Transfer browned chicken breasts to a plate and set aside.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add onion, garlic, and ginger to the oil remaining in the skillet. Cook and stir until onion turns soft and translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir curry powder, cumin, turmeric, coriander, cayenne, and 1 tablespoon of water into the onion mixture; allow to heat together for about 1 minute while stirring. Add tomatoes, yogurt, 1 tablespoon chopped cilantro, and 1 teaspoon salt to the mixture; stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Return chicken breast to the skillet along with any juices on the plate. Pour in 1/2 cup water and bring to a boil, turning the chicken to coat with the sauce. Sprinkle garam masala and 1 tablespoon cilantro over the chicken.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and simmer until chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Drizzle with lemon juice to serve.</li>
    </ol>
