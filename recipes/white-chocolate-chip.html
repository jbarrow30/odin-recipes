    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

    <p>This is the reverse chocolate chip cookie! Rich dark 
        chocolate with white chocolate chips. These White Chocolate
        Chip Cookies will be your new favorite thing. They’re soft, 
        buttery, chewy, and crispy, everything a cookie should be, 
        and packed full of white chocolate.</p> 
        <p>I use a mix of white and brown sugar so these cookies have a delicious molasses, 
        caramelized flavor, and top them with extra white chocolate 
        chips because you can never have enough, right? And with no 
        chilling time required these cookies can be whipped up in a 
        matter of minutes plus they keep well for ages (not that 
        they’ll last long). </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups unsweetend cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>2 cups white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar and white sugar until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. Combine the cocoa, flour, and baking soda, gradually stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, fold in white chocolate chips. Drop by rounded spoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until puffy but still soft. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
